Probabilistic object detection is the task of detecting objects in images
and accurately quantifying the spatial and semantic uncertainties of the
detection. Measuring uncertainty is important in robotic applications
where actions based on erroneous, but high confidence visual detections,
can lead to catastrophic consequences. In this paper, we introduce a new
technique that combines two popular methods to estimate uncertainty in
object detection. Quantifying uncertainty is critical in realworld robotic
applications. Traditional detection models can be ambiguous even when they
provide a high-probability output. Robot actions based on high-confidence,
yet unreliable predictions, may result in serious repercussions. Our
framework employs deep ensembles and Monte Carlo dropout for approximating
predictive uncertainty, and it improves upon the uncertainty estimation
quality of the baseline method. The proposed approach is evaluated on
publicly available synthetic image datasets captured from sequences of video.
