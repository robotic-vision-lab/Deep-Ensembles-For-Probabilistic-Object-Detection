usage: submission_validator.py [-h] [-q] submission_directory

Validator script for submissions to the challenge. Call this script on a
submission to check for errors and invalid values in your submission before
uploading.

positional arguments:
  submission_directory  The folder containing the submission to validate. Zip
                        up and submit this folder when done.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -q, --quiet           Suppress warning messages, which may occur when class
                        probabilities are not normalized or detections are
                        ignored. These are not errors, and may produce
                        excessive output
